Here I record the growth hacking related knowledge I learned during building projects at [t9t.io](http://t9t.io). This recipe will be continuously updated.

## Why do I start to care

I like building solutions. For the last several years, after I finish a product, what I do to find users is sharing it in several forums like HN or PD. Many times the product did not get much traction and it feels depressing. It makes me wonder if the tool I built is useless.

One of the projects changed my mind and make me start to care about growth hacking. It is a simple tool called [star-history](https://github.com/star-history), which displays star number history of github repos. It get nearly no upvotes when I first [share it to HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10271641) or several other tech forums. But as time goes by, beyond my expectation, this simple tool gets more and more stars. And when I published a paid [chrome extension version](https://github.com/timqian/star-history-plugin) on chrome webstore recently. People starts to pay for this simple tool even it is open sourced and free to download without paying. So I checked the traffic of the project on github. The major traffic source is Google search and some popular blog posts people mentioning it.

This experience from myself reminds me two ideas I have read about in many other places but failed to nail them down on my mind.

1. Initial upvotes is not the key to a successful product.
2. Building a beautiful product is important. And make it easy for people to find it is equally important.

That's when I started to actually care about growth hacking.

## Three aspects to work on

### 1. A beautiful product

This is always the most important thing to remember.

### 2. More exposure

- More channels of traffic
  - Before building the product. You should have done lots of searches and should have found places where people are searching for the product or asking related questions. You should note them down and they will be great channels to share after you finish your product.
  - Launch at all the platforms you can think of: HN; PD; Reddit; V2EX(China);
  - Search and answer related questions on Quora; Zhihu(China) or any where people asking questions
  - Write blog about your product, why you build it, what you learned though building it. And share this blog to as many platform as you can
- SEO
  - use [google search console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
  - upload sitemap to search console
  - `<title/>`; `<head/>`; `<h1/>`; `<meta name="description" content=""/>`
  - have more good source link to your websites

### 3. Start to record and improve conversion rates

- Activation: view => install/signup
- Retention: view/install/signup => active user
- Referrals: view/user => share
- Revenue: user => paid user
