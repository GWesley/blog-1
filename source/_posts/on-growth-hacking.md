Here I record the growth hacking related knowledge I learned during building projects at [t9t.io](http://t9t.io). This recipe will be continuously updated.

## Why should you care

Competition in software industry is becoming more and more intense. Besides building a beautiful product, it's very important for makkers to know the ways to get traffics to your product.

For the last several years, after I finish building a product, what I do to find users is sharing it in several forums like HN or PD. Many times the product did not get much traction, and it feel depressing. It makes me wondering if the tool I built is useless.

One project changed my mind. A simple tool called [star-history](https://github.com/star-history) which did not much attraction when I share to HN or several other tech forum. But as time goes by, the project gets more and more stars. And people even willing to pay forI find it is after building dozens of products I find out the truth is, initial upvotes is not the key to successful product. One of the project I made has most users did not get much upvotes on HN, but it is generating revenues for me. The major traffic of that is organic search result from google.

## Acquisition: user come to your site from various channels

- Before building the product. You should have done lots of searches and should have found places where people are searching for the product or asking related questions. You should note them down and they will be great channels to share after you finish your product.
- Launch at all the platforms you can think of: HN; PD; Reddit; V2EX(China);
- Search and answer related questions on Quora; Zhihu(China) or any where people asking questions
- Write blog about your product, why you build it, what you learned though building it. And share this blog to as many platform as you can
