About Reco

Recommend your favorite product and get reward.

We see ads everyday and everywhere all over the internet. Normally,

> The ads are so bad, and so full of malware and viruses that we've all started to install ad blockers. And if we don't have ad blockers, we just don't really click on ads a lot anymore (again, because they're so shit). Ads these days are annoying, ugly and spammy.

We hate ads. This is also not good for provider because they payed for these ads but did not get much valuable customers. Does ads must be so annoying? For example, [nomad list]() the author of this site have ads in his site. It is not normal google ads or some other ads unions random picked ads. Instead, the funder pick ads to show by hand. Because he knows what the visitors of his site likes or what problem they have. He pick the products that might help his customer and show them as ads in the website. In resluts, his users like the ads and he make more money the plug ugly google ads into his site. Win win!

I was thinking, it will be good if we have a platform where product maker can post there product on it. And others can choose products on the list and advertize them on their way and get rewarded.

For product posters, they can decide how they would like to pay for people sharing their products. And for product sharer, the can choose what interests them, what they like most to their friends or add as ads in their website.

Normally we will be very glad to try it out. Dislike random ads google push to us.

So I made this platform, to make advertization better. When we receive an introduction of a new product from our friends or trusted product maker. We don't call it ads, we call it recommendation. That's why this platform is call Reco(short for "recommendation")
